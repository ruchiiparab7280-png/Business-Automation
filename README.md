## 🚀 Quick Start (Local)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruchiiparab7280-png/Business-Automation.git
   cd WhatsApp-automation-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 🌐 Deployment (Render)

This project is pre-configured for **Render**.

1. Connect this GitHub repo to your Render dashboard.
2. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file.
3. **Important**: If using the Free Tier, the server will sleep after 15 mins. The app includes a "Self-Ping" mechanism, but for 100% uptime, use a "Starter" plan with a "Persistent Disk" mounted to `/sessions`.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.js`: Core server, authentication, and WhatsApp bot logic.
- `index.html`: Modern dashboard UI with tabs and exports.
- `sessions/`: (Auto-generated) Stores encrypted WhatsApp login states.
- `campaigns/`: (Auto-generated) Stores active background task states.
- `history/`: (Auto-generated) Stores user messaging logs.
- `users.json`: (Auto-generated) Encrypted user database.

## 🛡️ Security

- Passwords are hashed using **SHA-256**.
- Sessions are isolated; users cannot see each other's data or WhatsApp connections.
- `.gitignore` prevents sensitive data from being uploaded to public repositories.
